# My Book Library

This is my first personal book library. I can add books, delete them, and toggle their read status — all from the browser with no backend or database needed.

## Features

- Add new books via a form (Title, Author, Pages, Read Status)
- View all books in card format
- Delete books from your library
- Toggle whether a book is marked as read
- Books are displayed in columns

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling (responsive grid layout for book cards)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for interactivity and dynamic content manipulation

### Project Structure
├── index.html # Main HTML file
├── styles.css # CSS for layout and styling
└── javascript.js # JavaScript for library functionality
